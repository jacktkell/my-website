            <p>My name is Jack Kelling. Although I am enrolled in the DC course, I am taking advantage of the online delivery as I live in Panama City, Florida. 
                I've been here for 8 years but I've also lived in Alabama where I went to Troy University pursuing my Bachelor's in Literature, although I dropped out 
                just before Covid-19 became the major force that it is because I was unhappy with the state the English department was in and was doubting if teaching 
                was the career for me. Prior to Troy and Panama City, my family has lived in Texas, Colorado, and Iowa.</p>

            <p>My whole life I've been told that any career in technology is the way to go. It's always expanding, always hiring, pays well, and contributes to society. 
                That's all well and good, but I imagined it as a boring desk job and ruled it out as a possibility for years. It was only recently as I was changing 
                my mind about teaching that my brother got a job as programmer and liked it so much that he got his wife into it. And she liked it so much that she quit 
                nursing to pursue it full time. Obviously, I had misjudged the field. After talking to them about how challenging and engaging the work can be I bought 
                a Java course on Udemy and fell for it. I decided the proper way to learn everything I could and get a job was to follow in their steps and enroll with 
                Flatiron, so here I am.</p>

        <div>
            <p>If you hadn't guessed by the fact that I devoted three years of study and too much money to the subject, I am an avid reader. I think when I truly fell 
                in love with reading was at school when I was, at a guess, in sixth grade. My eyes were drawn to a thick hardback with a circle made from flowing cursive 
                looking characters and in the center of the circle was an eye. I went to check it out and the librarian warned me it was probably too advanced for my 
                reading level. I took to the challenge and found my favorite book - The Lord of the Rings. I've gone through hiatuses where I won't have the drive to read 
                or can't seem to finish books, but then there's always one that rekindles the passion. Currently that book is 11/22/63 by Stephen King, who is 
                simultaneously one of my favorite authors and among my most loathed authors. Some of my other favorites include Neil Gaiman, Ernest Hemingway, Walt Whitman, 
                Cormac McCarthy, and, of course, J. R. R. Tolkien. 
                <br>I have liked playing video games from a young age. I prefer story driven games or challenging games that take a long time to beat so that I feel like I 
                got my money's worth. Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Witcher 3 are my favorites, although I've replayed Ocarina of Time more times than I can count. 
                Similarly, I love board games and card games. 7 Wonders and Magic: The Gathering are my favorites at the moment. </p>
